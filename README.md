Kotlin OOP 

This is my hub of Kotlin Object Orentated Porgramming (OOP for short), that I will add to over time for all Kotlin related things.
My first kotlin program is based around Animals as the base class and sub class of Dog or Cat or Horse as an example.
development is an on going and eveolding process.  I will add and possable make changes as I go.
